It explains what data we collect, how we use it, retention and deletion practices, and how you can contact us. </p></section><section data-v-6572f715><h2 data-v-6572f715>Google OAuth data usage</h2><p data-v-6572f715> When you sign in with Google, Todo Batucore requests only the basic identity scopes needed to authenticate: openid, email, and profile. We use this information (name, email, profile picture) only to create and manage your account and personalize the app. We do not use this data for advertising or profiling. </p><p data-v-6572f715> The only additional Google API scope we request is: <code data-v-6572f715>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events</code> — solely to create and manage calendar events that correspond to your tasks when you opt into calendar sync. </p></section><section data-v-6572f715><h2 data-v-6572f715>Google Calendar data usage</h2><p data-v-6572f715> If you enable Google Calendar integration, Todo Batucore will create, update, and delete events in your Google Calendar corresponding to tasks you choose to sync. We use only the Calendar Events scope to perform these operations on your behalf. We do not read or retain full calendar contents; we only store the calendar event ID needed to maintain synchronization between a task and its calendar event. </p></section><section data-v-6572f715><h2 data-v-6572f715>Data retention policy</h2><p data-v-6572f715> We retain your account profile information for as long as your account exists. Calendar event identifiers (event_id) are retained only to maintain synchronization while your account is active. </p></section><section data-v-6572f715><h2 data-v-6572f715>Google User Data Retention and Deletion</h2><p data-v-6572f715> Explicit rules for Google-related data: </p><ul data-v-6572f715><li data-v-6572f715>Only the Google Calendar event_id is stored on our servers for synchronization; full event content is not stored.</li><li data-v-6572f715>When you disconnect your Google account or delete your Todo Batucore account, we permanently delete all Google-related data (linked profile info, event_id mappings, and tokens) from our production systems within 30 days.</li><li data-v-6572f715>You may request immediate deletion of your Google data at any time by contacting us (see Contact Information).</li></ul></section><section data-v-6572f715><h2 data-v-6572f715>Data deletion policy</h2><p data-v-6572f715> After account deletion or explicit deletion requests we purge associated data (including Google links and event_id mappings) within 30 days. Any retained backups containing that data are removed according to our backup retention schedule. </p></section><section data-v-6572f715><h2 data-v-6572f715>Limited Use and Google API Services User Data Policy</h2><p data-v-6572f715> Our use of Google APIs follows the Google API Services User Data Policy and the Limited Use requirements.
